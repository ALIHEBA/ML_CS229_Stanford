# Linear regression is a supervised learining algorithm used when target / dependent variable continues real number. It establishes relationship between dependent variable  y  and one or more independent variable  x  using best fit line.
# It work on the principle of ordinary least square  (OLS)  / Mean square errror  (MSE) . In statistics ols is method to estimated unkown parameter of linear regression function
# it's goal is to minimize sum of square difference between observed dependent variable in the given data set and those predicted by linear regression fuction.
# The goal of supervised learning is to learn a hypothesis function  h , for a given training set that can used to estimate  y  based on  x . So hypothesis fuction represented as

A cost function measures how much error in the model is in terms of ability to estimate the relationship between  x  and  y . We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference of observed dependent variable in the given the dataset and those predicted by the hypothesis function.
