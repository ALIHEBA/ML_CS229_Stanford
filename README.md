# 1. Linear regression 
is a supervised learining algorithm used when target / dependent variable continues real number. It establishes relationship between dependent variable  y  and one or more independent variable  x  using best fit line.
 It work on the principle of ordinary least square  (OLS)  / Mean square errror  (MSE) . In statistics ols is method to estimated unkown parameter of linear regression function
 it's goal is to minimize sum of square difference between observed dependent variable in the given data set and those predicted by linear regression fuction.
 The goal of supervised learning is to learn a hypothesis function  h , for a given training set that can used to estimate  y  based on  x . So hypothesis fuction represented as

A cost function measures how much error in the model is in terms of ability to estimate the relationship between  x  and  y . We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference of observed dependent variable in the given the dataset and those predicted by the hypothesis function.

#Heatmap
According to the Oxford dictionary, a heatmap (or heat map) is “a representation of data in the form of a map or diagram in which data values are represented as colors”. One of the most effective ways to express a heatmap that can be used on mathematical models is through the use of matrices where each cell represents a square portion of space in a given measuring distance system and the colors represent the intensity of the studied event that happened on each cell mapped.
